#Scripting

###What is a Script?

A script is a program that runs a series of statments and stops.
If you write a useful script it will grow in features and functionality. You may want to apply it to other related problems. Over time it could become a critical application so its important to stay organized.

###Defining Things

Names must always be defined before they get used later.
The order is important. You almost always put the definitions of variables and functions near the top.

###Defining Functions

It is a good idea to put all of the code related to a single task all in one place. Use a function...

```python

def read_prices(filename):
	prices = {}
	with open(filename) as f:
		f_csv = csv.reader(f)
		for row in f_csv:
			prices[row[0]] = float(row[1])
	return prices

```
A function also simplifies repeated operations:

```python
old_prices = read_prices('old.csv')
new_prices = read_prices('new.csv')
```

###What is a Function?

A function is a named sequence of statements, any Python statment can be used inside.

Functions can be defined in any order and must only be defined prior to actually being used during program execution.

###Function Design

Ideally functions should be black box. They should only operate on passed inputs and avoid global variables and mysterious side effects. The main goals are Modularity and Predictability
