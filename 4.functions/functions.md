# Functions

As programs start to get larger, they need to be organized

## Custom Functions

Use functions for code that is to be reused.

```python
def sumcount(n):
	```
	Returns the sum of the first n integers
	```
	total = 0
	while n > 0:
		total += n
		n -= 1
	return total
```

Then to call that function:
```python
a = sumcount(100)
```

A function is a series of statements that perform some task and return a result. The ```return```keyword is needed to explicitly specify the return value of the function.

## Library Functions

Python comes with a large standard library, modules are accesses using ```Ã¬mport```

```python
import math
x = math.sqrt(10)

import urllib.request
u = urllib.request.urlopen('http://www.python.org')
data = u.read()

```
## Errors and exceptions

Functions report errors as exceptions. An exception causes a function to abort and may cause your entire program to stop if unhandled

Exceptions can be caught and handled. To catch, use the ```try - except ```statement.

```python
for line in f:
	fields = line.split()
	try:
		shares = int(fields[1])
	except ValueError:
		print('couldnt parse', line)

```

The name 'ValueError' must match the kind of error you are trying to catch.

It can be difficult to predict all errors, exception handling often gets added after a program has unexpectadly crashed.

## Raising Exceptions

To raise an exception use the ```raise```statement.

```python
raise RuntimeError('oh my')
```

This will cause the program to abort with an exception traceback. Unless caught by a try-except block

## Exercises:

Defining a simple function: If the first statement of a function is a string, it serves a documentation.

```python
def greeting(name):
    'Issues a greeting'
     print('Hello', name)

>>> greeting('Guido')
Hello Guido
>>> greeting('Paula')
Hello Paula
>>>
```
Using ```help(greeting)``` will give the string doc

Exercise 1.30: Turning a script into a function (Turn pcost.py into a function - stored in Work folder)

When running pcost.py you should see the same output as before. After running program the function can also be called interactively using:

```$ python3 -i pcost.py```

This call the function in interactive mode and cann be useful when experimenting, testing and debugging code
